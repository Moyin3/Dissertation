And because velocity is constant we have $\\dot{x}$ = $\\dot{x}$. So we have $$\\bar{x}_k = 1 \\cdot x_{k-1} + \\Delta t\\,\\dot{x_{k-1}}$$ and  $$\\bar{\\dot{x}} = 0 \\cdot x_{k - 1} + 1 \\cdot \\dot{x_{k-1}}$$ this gives us our matrix form. $$\\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{x} \\\\ \\bar{\\dot{x}} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\Delta t \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_{k-1} \\\\ \\dot{x_{k-1}} \\end{bmatrix}$$ $$ \\bar{x} = Fx $$\n",
