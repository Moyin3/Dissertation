    "Then for my Covariance matrix I chose 16.0 because the square root would give me a standard deviation of 4, meaning that I am 99.7% sure of the position of the car ± 12 metres. I believe the maximum speed on the motorway is 70mph so roughly converted that into 31.38 ms-1. This would be the maximum of speed our car could have, so made this equal to 3 times the standard deviation, and then computed the variance to be about 109. Then I chose both the top right and bottom left of the matrix to be 0, because while I know they are related I'm not entirely sure of how I would put this into integer form, so I would let the updating nature of the filter fill this in eventually.\n",

    "For the Process Model, F, in our constant velocity model the position is given to us by $\\bar{x}$ = x + $\\dot{x}$, where $\\bar{x}$ is our state estimate, and $\\dot{x}$ is the derivate of the position, i.e. the velocity. And because velocity is constant we have $\\dot{x}$ = $\\dot{x}$. So we have $$\\bar{x}_k = 1 \\cdot x_{k-1} + \\Delta t\\,\\dot{x_{k-1}}$$ and  $$\\bar{\\dot{x}} = 0 \\cdot x_{k - 1} + 1 \\cdot \\dot{x_{k-1}}$$ this gives us our matrix form. $$\\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{x} \\\\ \\bar{\\dot{x}} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\Delta t \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_{k-1} \\\\ \\dot{x_{k-1}} \\end{bmatrix}$$ $$ \\bar{x} = Fx $$\n",
