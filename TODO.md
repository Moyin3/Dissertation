Make filters more like Kalman incorporating uncertainty(think Covariance matrices) and updated Kalman gain.
Try to plot elipses on plot to show uncertainty.




Identify data 

Need to change the markdown so it reflects the thinking behind my 2D components.

For next week:
Tests to ensure the maths is correct.
Combine the different parameters to see if I can find an ideal set of values
Play with data, see if there are already applications of tracking on data.
Try find data where someone has applied filter to for comparison.
